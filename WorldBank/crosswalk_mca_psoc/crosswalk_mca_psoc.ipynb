    "We’ll load the PSOC Excel file and focus only on two columns: Job Title and ISCO code. The ISCO code will serve as the key to link PSOC with O*NET, where we can attach the AIOE and Complementarity scores. We also have to note that The PSA lists job titles in a clear cycle. Each section starts with the main job title in all caps, followed by a description of tasks. It then introduces related titles with the phrase “Examples of the occupations classified here:”. The cycle repeats with a new ISCO code whenever a new all-caps job title appears. We will utilize this to get a one to many mapping of the ISCO code to the job title."
