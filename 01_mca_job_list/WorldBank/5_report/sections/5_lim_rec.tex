Based on the study, one key limitation is the reliance on a US-based dataset.
Although the focus is on Filipino jobs, the AIOE and complementarity scores are derived from the O*NET database.
This approach remains acceptable, as other studies, such as those by Cucio \& Hennig (\citeyear{cucio2025}) and Gymrek (\citeyear{gmyrek2024}), have applied the same method to the Filipino and Latin American labor markets, respectively.

A recommendation for future research is to incorporate labor supply and demand by weighting results according to the quantity of jobs supplied and demanded. The current methodology relies only on the job list and does not account for whether these jobs are actually in demand.
